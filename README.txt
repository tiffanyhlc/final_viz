## Final Deliverable - Weather Across Cities in the U.S.

Welcome to the Weather Visualization project! We've built an interactive tool using D3.js and JavaScript to explore one year of weather data from US cities. Our intuitive web-based visualization lets you analyze weather patterns across different regions with ease.

### Features and Functionality

1. Dynamic City Selection
   One of the standout features of our visualization is the ability for users to dynamically select different cities from a dropdown menu.

2. Time-Series Plot
   The heart of our visualization lies in the time-series line plot, which graphically represents the mean temperature over the selected time period.

3. Responsive Design
   We understand the importance of accessibility, which is why our visualization is designed to be responsive.

4. Data Parsing and Processing
   Behind the scenes, our script diligently parses CSV files containing weather data for each city.

### Project Structure

- index.html: This HTML file serves as the entry point for the web-based visualization, providing the structure of the web page.

- script.js: The JavaScript file script.js handles the loading of data and generation of the visualization using D3.js, orchestrating the interactive elements and dynamic updates.

- style.css: CSS styles defined in style.css enhance the visual presentation and layout of the web page, ensuring a polished user interface.

- Weather_Data/: This directory contains CSV files containing weather data for each city, which are parsed and visualized in the project.
